# Naftiko Specification

**Version 0.4**

**Publication Date:** February 2026

---

- **Table of Contents**

## 1. Introduction

The Naftiko Specification defines a standard, language-agnostic interface for describing modular, composable capabilities. In short, a **capability** is a functional unit that consumes external APIs (sources) and exposes adapters that allow other systems to interact with it.

A Naftiko capability focuses on declaring the **integration intent** — what a system needs to consume and what it exposes — rather than implementation details. This higher-level abstraction makes capabilities naturally suitable for AI-driven discovery, orchestration and integration use cases, and beyond. When properly defined, a capability can be discovered, orchestrated, validated and executed with minimal implementation logic. The specification enables description of:

- **Consumed sources**: External APIs or services that the capability uses
- **Exposed adapters**: Server interfaces that the capability provides (HTTP, REST, etc.)
- **Orchestration**: How calls to consumed sources are combined and mapped to realize exposed functions
- **External references**: Variables and resources resolved from external sources

### 1.1 Schema Access

The JSON Schema for the Naftiko Specification is available in two forms:

- **Raw file** — The schema source file is hosted on GitHub: [capability-schema.json](https://github.com/naftiko/framework/blob/main/src/main/resources/schemas/capability-schema.json)
- **Interactive viewer** — A human-friendly viewer is available at: [Schema Viewer](https://naftiko.github.io/schema-viewer/)

### 1.2 Core Objects

**Capability**: The central object that defines a modular functional unit with clear input/output contracts. 

**Consumes**: External sources (APIs, services) that the capability uses to realize its operations.

**Exposes**: Server adapters that provide access to the capability's operations.

**Resources**: API endpoints that group related operations.

**Operations**: Individual HTTP operations (GET, POST, etc.) that can be performed on resources.

**Namespace**: A unique identifier for consumed sources, used for routing and mapping with the expose layer.

**ExternalRef**: A declaration of an external reference (variables, capabilities) resolved at runtime or from a file.

**Acknowledgments** — The Naftiko Specification is inspired by and builds upon foundational work from [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [Arazzo](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html), and [OpenCollections](https://opencollections.io/). We gratefully credit these initiatives and their communities for the patterns and conventions that informed this specification.

</aside>

Three specifications that work better together.

|  | **OpenAPI** | **Arazzo** | **OpenCollections** | **Naftiko** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Focus** | Defines *what* your API is — the contract, the schema, the structure. | Defines *how* API calls are sequenced — the workflows between endpoints. | Defines *how* to use your API — the scenarios, the runnable collections. | Defines *what* a capability consumes and exposes — the integration intent. |
| **Scope** | Single API surface | Workflows across one or more APIs | Runnable collections of API calls | Modular capability spanning multiple APIs |
| **Key strengths** | ✓ Endpoints & HTTP methods
✓ Request/response schemas
✓ Authentication requirements
✓ Data types & validation
✓ SDK & docs generation | ✓ Multi-step sequences
✓ Step dependencies & data flow
✓ Success/failure criteria
✓ Reusable workflow definitions | ✓ Runnable, shareable collections
✓ Pre-request scripts & tests
✓ Environment variables
✓ Living, executable docs | ✓ Consume/expose duality
✓ Namespace-based routing
✓ Orchestration & forwarding
✓ AI-driven discovery
✓ Composable capabilities |
| **Analogy** | The *parts list* and dimensions | The *assembly sequence* between parts | The *step-by-step assembly guide* you can run | The *product blueprint* — what goes in, what comes out |
| **Best used when you need to…** | Define & document an API contract, generate SDKs, validate payloads | Describe multi-step API workflows with dependencies | Share runnable API examples, test workflows, onboard developers | Declare a composable capability that consumes sources and exposes unified interfaces |

**OpenAPI** tells you the shape of the door. **Arazzo** describes the sequence of doors to walk through. **OpenCollections** lets you actually walk through them. **Naftiko** builds the room — connecting what comes in to what goes out.

## 2. Format

Naftiko specifications can be represented either in JSON or YAML format, complying with the provided Naftiko schema which is made available in both JSON Schema and JSON Structure formats.

All field names in the specification are **case-sensitive**.

Naftiko Objects expose two types of fields:

- **Fixed fields**: which have a declared name
- **Patterned fields**: which have a declared pattern for the field name

- `with` is optional (inject parameters into the call)
- `outputParameters` are `MappedOutputParameter[]` (type + mapping)
- `steps` MUST NOT be present
- `name` is optional

**Orchestrated mode** — A multi-step orchestration:

> 

#### 3.11.1 ConsumedInputParameter Object

Used in consumed resources and operations.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Parameter name. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-*]+$`. |
| **in** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Parameter location. Valid values: `"query"`, `"header"`, `"path"`, `"cookie"`, `"body"`. |
| **value** | `string` | Value or JSONPath reference. |

**Rules:**

- Both `name` and `in` are mandatory.
- The `name` field MUST match the pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-*]+$`.
- The `in` field MUST be one of: `"query"`, `"header"`, `"path"`, `"cookie"`, `"body"`.
- A unique parameter is defined by the combination of `name` and `in`.
- No additional properties are allowed.

**ConsumedInputParameter Example:**

```yaml
- name: username
  in: path
- name: page
  in: query
- name: Authorization
  in: header
  value: "Bearer env.TOKEN"
```

#### 3.11.2 ExposedInputParameter Object

Used in exposed resources and operations. Extends the consumed variant with `type` and `description` (both required) for agent discoverability, plus an optional `pattern` for validation.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Parameter name. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-*]+$`. |
| **in** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Parameter location. Valid values: `"query"`, `"header"`, `"path"`, `"cookie"`, `"body"`. |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Data type of the parameter. One of: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`. |
| **description** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Human-readable description of the parameter. Essential for agent discovery. |
| **pattern** | `string` | Optional regex pattern for parameter value validation. |
| **value** | `string` | Default value or JSONPath reference. |

**Rules:**

- All of `name`, `in`, `type`, and `description` are mandatory.
- The `name` field MUST match the pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-*]+$`.
- The `in` field MUST be one of: `"query"`, `"header"`, `"path"`, `"cookie"`, `"body"`.

- name: page_size
  in: query
  type: number
  description: Number of results per page (max 100)
```

### 3.12 OutputParameter Objects

> Update (schema v0.4): The single `OutputParameter` object has been split into three distinct types: **ConsumedOutputParameter** (used in consumed operations), **MappedOutputParameter** (used in simple-mode exposed operations), and **OrchestratedOutputParameter** (used in orchestrated-mode exposed operations).
> 

#### 3.12.1 ConsumedOutputParameter Object

Used in consumed operations to extract values from the raw API response.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Output parameter name. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$`. |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Data type. One of: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`. |
| **value** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. JsonPath expression to extract value from consumed function response. |

**Rules:**

- All three fields (`name`, `type`, `value`) are mandatory.
- The `name` field MUST match the pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-_*]+$`.
- The `value` field MUST start with `$`.
- No additional properties are allowed.

**ConsumedOutputParameter Example:**

```yaml
outputParameters:
  - name: dbName
    type: string
    value: $.title[0].text.content
  - name: dbId
    type: string
    value: $.id
```

#### 3.12.2 MappedOutputParameter Object

Used in **simple mode** exposed operations. Maps a value from the consumed response using `type` and `mapping`.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Data type. One of: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`. |
| **mapping** | `string` | `object` | **REQUIRED**. For scalar types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`): a JsonPath string. For `object`: an object with `properties` (recursive MappedOutputParameter map). For `array`: an object with `items` (recursive MappedOutputParameter). |

**Subtypes by type:**

- **`string`**, **`number`**, **`boolean`**: `mapping` is a JsonPath string (e.g. `$.login`)
- **`object`**: `mapping` is `{ properties: { key: MappedOutputParameter, ... } }` — recursive
- **`array`**: `mapping` is `{ items: MappedOutputParameter }` — recursive

**Rules:**

- Both `type` and `mapping` are mandatory.
- No additional properties are allowed.

**MappedOutputParameter Examples:**

```yaml
# Scalar mapping
outputParameters:
  - type: string
    mapping: $.login
  - type: number
    mapping: $.id

# Object mapping (recursive)
outputParameters:
  - type: object
    mapping:
      properties:
        username:
          type: string
          mapping: $.login
        userId:
          type: number
          mapping: $.id

# Array mapping (recursive)
outputParameters:
  - type: array
    mapping:
      items:
        type: object
        mapping:
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
              mapping: $.name
```

#### 3.12.3 OrchestratedOutputParameter Object

Used in **orchestrated mode** exposed operations. Declares an output by `name` and `type` (the value is populated via step mappings).

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Output parameter name. |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Data type. One of: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`. |

**Subtypes by type:**

- **`string`**, **`number`**, **`boolean`** (scalar): only `name` and `type`
- **`array`**: adds `items` (recursive OrchestratedOutputParameter without `name`)
- **`object`**: adds `properties` (map of name → recursive OrchestratedOutputParameter without `name`)

**Rules:**

- Both `name` and `type` are mandatory.
- No additional properties are allowed.

**OrchestratedOutputParameter Example:**

```yaml
outputParameters:
  - name: db_name
    type: string
  - name: Api-Version
    type: string
  - name: results
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        title:
          type: string
```

#### 3.12.4 JsonPath roots (extensions)

In a consumed resource, **`$`** refers to the *raw response payload* of the consumed operation (after decoding based on `outputRawFormat`). The root `$` gives direct access to the JSON response body.

Example, if you consider the following JSON response :

```json
{
  "id": "154548",
  "titles": [
    {
      "text": {
        "content": "This is title[0].text.content",
        "author": "user1"
      }
    }
  ],
  "created_time": "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

- `$.id` is `154548`
- `$.titles[0].text.content` is `This is title[0].text.content`

#### 3.12.5 Common patterns

- `$.fieldName` — accesses a top-level field
- `$.data.user.id` — accesses nested fields
- `$.items[0]` — accesses array elements
- `$.items[*].id` — accesses all ids in an array

---

### 3.13 OperationStep Object

Describes a single step in an orchestrated operation. `OperationStep` is a `oneOf` between two subtypes: **OperationStepCall** and **OperationStepLookup**, both sharing a common **OperationStepBase**.

> Update (schema v0.4): OperationStep is now a discriminated union (`oneOf`) with a required `type` field (`"call"` or `"lookup"`) and a required `name` field. `OperationStepCall` uses `with` (WithInjector) instead of `inputParameters`. `OperationStepLookup` is entirely new.
> 

#### 3.13.1 OperationStepBase (shared fields)

All operation steps share these base fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Step type discriminator. One of: `"call"`, `"lookup"`. |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Technical name for the step (pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`). Used as namespace for referencing step outputs in mappings and expressions. |

#### 3.13.2 OperationStepCall

Calls a consumed operation.

**Fixed Fields** (in addition to base):

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. MUST be `"call"`. |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Step name (from base). |
| **call** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Reference to consumed operation. Format: `{namespace}.{operationId}`. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`. |
| **with** | `WithInjector` | Parameter injection for the called operation. Keys are parameter names, values are strings or numbers (static values or `$this` references). |

**Rules:**

- `type`, `name`, and `call` are mandatory.
- The `call` field MUST follow the format `{namespace}.{operationName}`.
- The `namespace` portion MUST correspond to a namespace defined in one of the capability's consumes entries.
- The `operationName` portion MUST correspond to an operation `name` defined in the consumes entry identified by the namespace.
- `with` uses the same `WithInjector` object as simple-mode ExposedOperation (see §3.18).
- No additional properties are allowed.

#### 3.13.3 OperationStepLookup

Performs a lookup against the output of a previous call step, matching values and extracting fields.

**Fixed Fields** (in addition to base):

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. MUST be `"lookup"`. |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Step name (from base). |
| **index** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Name of a previous call step whose output serves as the lookup table. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`. |
| **match** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Name of the key field in the index to match against. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`. |
| **lookupValue** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. JsonPath expression resolving to the value(s) to look up. |
| **outputParameters** | `string[]` | **REQUIRED**. List of field names to extract from the matched index entries (minimum 1 entry). |

**Rules:**

- `type`, `name`, `index`, `match`, `lookupValue`, and `outputParameters` are all mandatory.
- `outputParameters` MUST contain at least one entry.
- The `index` value MUST reference the `name` of a previous `call` step in the same orchestration.
- No additional properties are allowed.

#### 3.13.4 Call Reference Resolution

The `call` value on an `OperationStepCall` is resolved as follows:

1. Split the value on the `.` character into namespace and operationName
2. Find the consumes entry with matching `namespace` field
3. Within that consumes entry's resources, find the operation with matching `name` field
4. Execute that operation as part of the orchestration sequence

#### 3.13.5 OperationStep Object Examples

**Call step with parameter injection:**

```yaml
steps:
  - type: call
    name: fetch-db
    call: notion.get-database
    with:
      database_id: $this.sample.database_id
```

**Lookup step (match against a previous call's output):**

```yaml
steps:
  - type: call
    name: list-users
    call: github.list-users
  - type: lookup
    name: find-user
    index: list-users
    match: email
    lookupValue: $this.sample.user_email
    outputParameters:
      - login
      - id
```

**Multi-step orchestration (call + lookup):**

```yaml
steps:
  - type: call
    name: get-entries
    call: api.list-entries
  - type: lookup
    name: resolve-entry
    index: get-entries
    match: entry_id
    lookupValue: $this.sample.target_id
    outputParameters:
      - title
      - status
  - type: call
    name: post-result
    call: slack.post-message
    with:
      text: $this.sample.title
```

---

### 3.14 StepOutputMapping Object

Describes how to map the output of an operation step to the input of another step or to the output of the exposed operation.

#### 3.14.1 Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **targetName** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The name of the parameter to map to. It can be an input parameter of a next step or an output parameter of the exposed operation. |
| **value** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. A JsonPath reference to the value to map from. E.g. `$.get-database.database_id`. |

#### 3.14.2 Rules

- Both `targetName` and `value` are mandatory.
- No additional properties are allowed.

#### 3.14.3 How mappings wire steps to exposed outputs

A StepOutputMapping connects the **output parameters of a consumed operation** (called by the step) to the **output parameters of the exposed operation** (or to input parameters of subsequent steps).

- **`targetName`** — refers to the `name` of an output parameter declared on the exposed operation, or the `name` of an input parameter of a subsequent step. The target parameter receives its value from the mapping.
- **`value`** — a JsonPath expression where **`$`** is the root of the consumed operation's output parameters. The syntax `$.{outputParameterName}` references a named output parameter of the consumed operation called in this step.

#### 3.14.4 End-to-end example

Consider a consumed operation `notion.get-database` that declares:

```yaml
# In consumes → resources → operations
name: "get-database"
outputParameters:
  - name: "dbName"
    value: "$.title[0].text.content"
```

And the exposed side of the capability:

```yaml
# In exposes
exposes:
  - type: "api"
    address: "localhost"
    port: 9090
    namespace: "sample"
    resources:
      - path: "/databases/{database_id}"
        name: "db"
        label: "Database resource"
        description: "Retrieve information about a Notion database"
        inputParameters:
          - name: "database_id"
            in: "path"
            type: "string"
            description: "The unique identifier of the Notion database"
        operations:
          - name: "get-db"
            method: "GET"
            label: "Get Database"
            outputParameters:
              - name: "db_name"
                type: "string"
            steps:
              - type: "call"
                name: "fetch-db"
                call: "notion.get-database"
                with:
                  database_id: "$this.sample.database_id"
            mappings:
              - targetName: "db_name"
                value: "$.dbName"
```

Here is what happens at orchestration time:

1. The step `fetch-db` calls `notion.get-database`, which extracts `dbName` and `dbId` from the raw response via its own output parameters.
2. The `with` injector passes `database_id` from the exposed input parameter (`$this.sample.database_id`) to the consumed operation.
3. The mapping `targetName: "db_name"` refers to the exposed operation's output parameter `db_name`.
4. The mapping `value: "$.dbName"` resolves to the value of the consumed operation's output parameter named `dbName`.
5. As a result, the exposed output `db_name` is populated with the value extracted by `$.dbName` (i.e. `title[0].text.content` from the raw Notion API response).

#### 3.14.5 StepOutputMapping Object Example

```yaml
mappings:
  - targetName: "db_name"
    value: "$.dbName"
```

---

### 3.15 `$this` Context Reference

Describes how `$this` references work in `with` (WithInjector) and other expression contexts.

> Update (schema v0.4): The former `OperationStepParameter` object (with `name` and `value` fields) has been replaced by `WithInjector` (see §3.18). This section now documents the `$this` expression root, which is used within `WithInjector` values.
> 

#### 3.15.1 The `$this` root

In a `with` (WithInjector) value — whether on an ExposedOperation (simple mode) or an OperationStepCall — the **`$this`** root references the *current capability execution context*, i.e. values already resolved during orchestration.

**`$this`** navigates the expose layer's input parameters using the path `$this.{exposeNamespace}.{inputParameterName}`. This allows a step or a simple-mode call to receive values that were provided by the caller of the exposed operation.

- **`$this.{exposeNamespace}.{paramName}`** — accesses an input parameter of the exposed resource or operation identified by its namespace.
- The `{exposeNamespace}` corresponds to the `namespace` of the exposed API.
- The `{paramName}` corresponds to the `name` of an input parameter declared on the exposed resource or operation.

#### 3.15.2 Example

If the exposed API has namespace `sample` and an input parameter `database_id` declared on its resource, then:

- `$this.sample.database_id` resolves to the value of `database_id` provided by the caller.

**Usage in a WithInjector:**

```yaml
call: notion.get-database
with:
  database_id: $this.sample.database_id
```

---

### 3.16 Authentication Object

Defines authentication configuration. Four types are supported: basic, apikey, bearer, and digest.

#### 3.16.1 Basic Authentication

HTTP Basic Authentication.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. MUST be `"basic"`. |
| **username** | `string` | Username for basic auth. |
| **password** | `string` | Password for basic auth. |

**Example:**

```yaml
authentication:
  type: basic
  username: admin
  password: "env.SECRET_PASSWORD"
```

#### 3.16.2 API Key Authentication

API Key authentication via header or query parameter.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. MUST be `"apikey"`. |
| **key** | `string` | API key name (header name or query parameter name). |
| **value** | `string` | API key value. |
| **placement** | `string` | Where to place the key. Valid values: `"header"`, `"query"`. |

**Example:**

```yaml
authentication:
  type: apikey
  key: X-API-Key
  value: "env.API_KEY"
  placement: header
```

#### 3.16.3 Bearer Token Authentication

Bearer token authentication.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. MUST be `"bearer"`. |
| **token** | `string` | Bearer token value. |

**Example:**

```yaml
authentication:
  type: bearer
  token: "env.BEARER_TOKEN"
```

#### 3.16.4 Digest Authentication

HTTP Digest Authentication.

**Fixed Fields:**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. MUST be `"digest"`. |
| **username** | `string` | Username for digest auth. |
| **password** | `string` | Password for digest auth. |

**Example:**

```yaml
authentication:
  type: digest
  username: admin
  password: "env.SECRET_PASSWORD"
```

#### 3.16.5 Rules

- Only one authentication type can be used per authentication object.
- The `type` field determines which additional fields are required or allowed.
- Authentication can be specified at multiple levels (exposes, consumes) with inner levels overriding outer levels.

---

### 3.17 ForwardConfig Object

Defines forwarding configuration for an exposed resource to pass requests through to a consumed namespace.

> Update (schema v0.4): Renamed from `ForwardHeaders` to `ForwardConfig`. The `targetNamespaces` array has been replaced by a single `targetNamespace` string.
> 

#### 3.17.1 Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **targetNamespace** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The consumer namespace to forward requests to. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`. |
| **trustedHeaders** | [`string`] | **REQUIRED**. List of headers allowed to be forwarded (minimum 1 entry). No wildcards supported. |

#### 3.17.2 Rules

- The `targetNamespace` field is mandatory and MUST reference a valid namespace from one of the capability's consumes entries.
- The `trustedHeaders` array is mandatory and MUST contain at least one entry.
- Header names in `trustedHeaders` are case-insensitive (following HTTP header conventions).
- Only headers listed in `trustedHeaders` will be forwarded to the consumed source.
- No additional properties are allowed.

#### 3.17.3 ForwardConfig Object Example

```yaml
forward:
  targetNamespace: notion
  trustedHeaders:
    - Authorization
    - Notion-Version
```

---

### 3.18 WithInjector Object

Defines parameter injection for simple-mode exposed operations. Used with the `with` field on an ExposedOperation to inject values into the called consumed operation.

> New in schema v0.4.
> 

#### 3.18.1 Shape

`WithInjector` is an object whose keys are parameter names and whose values are static values or `$this` references.

- Each key corresponds to a parameter `name` in the consumed operation's `inputParameters`.
- Each value is a `string` or a `number`: either a static value or a `$this.{namespace}.{paramName}` reference.

#### 3.18.2 Rules

- The keys MUST correspond to valid parameter names in the consumed operation being called.
- Values can be strings or numbers.
- String values can use the `$this` root to reference exposed input parameters (same as in OperationStepParameter).
- No additional constraints.

#### 3.18.3 WithInjector Object Example

```yaml
call: github.get-user
with:
  username: $this.sample.username
  Accept: "application/json"
  maxRetries: 3
```

---

### 3.19 ExternalRef Object

> New in schema v0.4.
> 

Declares an external reference that provides values or resources to the capability. External references are declared at the root level of the Naftiko document via the `externalRefs` array.

#### 3.19.1 Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Unique identifier for this external reference. MUST match pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`. Used as prefix in mustache expressions. |
| **type** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Type of external reference. Valid values: `"variables"`. |
| **description** | `string` | **REQUIRED**. Human-readable description of this external reference. Essential for agent discovery. |
| **resolution** | `string` | **REQUIRED.** Resolution strategy. Valid values: `"file"`, `"runtime"`. Default: `"runtime"`. |
| **uri** | `string` | URI or path to the external resource. **REQUIRED** when `resolution` is `"file"`. MUST NOT be present when `resolution` is `"runtime"`. |

#### 3.19.2 Resolution Strategies

The `resolution` field determines how values are resolved at runtime:

- **`"file"`** — Values are loaded from a local file specified by `uri`. The file format depends on the `type` (e.g. `.env` for variables). This mode is intended for **local development only**, where secrets and configuration can be stored in files excluded from version control (e.g. via `.gitignore`).
- **`"runtime"`** (default) — Values are injected by the execution environment at startup. The capability document does **not** specify where the values come from — this is delegated to the deployment platform. Typical production providers include:
    - **HashiCorp Vault** — centralized secrets management
    - **Kubernetes Secrets** / **ConfigMaps** — native K8s secret injection
    - **AWS Secrets Manager** / **AWS SSM Parameter Store**
    - **Azure Key Vault**
    - **GCP Secret Manager**
    - **Docker Secrets** — for containerized deployments
    - **CI/CD pipeline variables** (GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI variables, etc.)

<aside>
⚠️

**Security recommendation** — Never use `resolution: "file"` in production environments. File-based resolution exposes secret locations in the capability document and creates a risk of accidental secret leakage (e.g. committing `.env` files). Always use `resolution: "runtime"` in production, with secrets injected by a dedicated secrets manager.

</aside>

#### 3.19.3 Rules

- The `name`, `type`, and `description` fields are mandatory.
- The `name` value MUST be unique across all `externalRefs` entries.
- The `name` value MUST NOT collide with any `consumes` namespace to avoid ambiguity.
- When `resolution` is `"file"`, the `uri` field is **REQUIRED**.
- When `resolution` is `"runtime"` (or omitted), the `uri` field MUST NOT be present. The runtime environment is responsible for resolving the values.
- The default value for `resolution` is `"runtime"`.
- No additional properties are allowed.

#### 3.19.3 ExternalRef Object Examples

**Runtime resolution (production):**

```yaml
externalRefs:
  - name: env
    type: variables
    description: "Environment variables for secrets and configuration"
    resolution: runtime
```

**File resolution (development):**

```yaml
externalRefs:
  - name: env
    type: variables
    description: "Environment variables loaded from local file"
    resolution: file
    uri: "./env/dev.env"
```

---

### 3.20 Expression Syntax

Values from external references are injected into the capability document using mustache-style expressions.

#### 3.20.1 Format

The expression format is `name.key`, where:

- `name` corresponds to the `name` of a declared `externalRefs` entry
- `key` is the identifier of the value to resolve within that external reference

Expressions can appear in any `string` value within the document, including authentication tokens, header values, and input parameter values.

#### 3.20.2 Resolution

At runtime, expressions are resolved as follows:

1. Find the `externalRefs` entry with matching `name`
2. Resolve `key` using the strategy defined by `resolution` (`file` lookup or `runtime` injection)
3. Replace the expression with the resolved value

If a referenced `name` is not declared in `externalRefs`, the document MUST be considered invalid.

#### 3.20.3 Relationship with `$this`

Mustache expressions and `$this` references serve different purposes:

- `name.key` resolves **static configuration** from external references (secrets, environment variables)
- `$this.{exposeNamespace}.{paramName}` resolves **runtime orchestration** values from the expose layer's input parameters

The two expression systems are independent and MUST NOT be mixed.

#### 3.20.4 Expression Examples

```yaml
# Authentication token from external ref
authentication:
  type: bearer
  token: "env.NOTION_TOKEN"

# Header value from external ref
headers:
  - "Authorization: Bearer env.API_KEY"
```

## 4. Complete Examples

This section provides progressive examples — from the simplest capability to a full-featured one — to illustrate the main patterns of the specification. All examples are pseudo-functional and use realistic API shapes.

### 4.1 Forward-only capability (proxy)

The simplest capability: forward incoming requests to a consumed API without any transformation.

```yaml
---
naftiko: "0.4"
info:
  label: "Notion Proxy"
  description: "Pass-through proxy to the Notion API for development and debugging"
  tags:
    - proxy
    - notion
  created: "2026-02-01"
  modified: "2026-02-01"

capability:
  exposes:
    - type: "api"
      port: 8080
      namespace: "proxy"
      resources:
        - path: "/notion/{path}"
          description: "Forwards all requests to the Notion API"
          forward:
            targetNamespace: "notion"
            trustedHeaders:
              - "Authorization"
              - "Notion-Version"

  consumes:
    - type: "http"
      namespace: "notion"
      description: "Notion public API"
      baseUri: "https://api.notion.com/v1"
      resources:
        - name: "all"
          path: "/{path}"
          operations:
            - name: "any"
              method: "GET"
```

### 4.2 Simple-mode capability (direct call)

A single exposed operation that directly calls a consumed operation, maps parameters with `with`, and extracts output.

```yaml

## 5. Versioning

The Naftiko Specification uses semantic versioning. The `naftiko` field in the Naftiko Object specifies the exact version of the specification (e.g., `"0.4"`). 

Tools processing Naftiko documents MUST validate this field to ensure compatibility with the specification version they support.

---

This specification defines how to describe modular, composable capabilities that consume multiple sources and expose unified interfaces, supporting orchestration, authentication, and flexible routing patterns.
